            <h2>Things to Do in Ithaca</h2>
            <p>From hiking to going to a vineyard, Ithaca is full of activities that you and your family can explore during your visit. If you are staying a few days, or if you have some extra time after attending the Apple Harvest Festival, here are some things you can do in the Ithaca area.</p>

            <h3>Hiking</h3>

            <p>Taughannock Falls State Park, Buttermilk Falls State Park, and Treman State Park, are all full of waterfalls, gorges, and beautiful views that you can explore through winding trails. There are many trails, ranging in distances and difficulty. These parks are all within a 20-minute drive of the Ithaca Commons.</p>

            <p>Cornell University has a beautiful campus bustling with students in the fall. The views from the slope are gorge-ous as the leaves change, and Beebe lake near north campus is a beautiful, short walk. The Cornell Botanical Gardens also feature beautiful flowers and foliage to stroll through.</p>

            <h3>Vineyard</h3>

            <p>If the cider and wine vendors at the festival weren't enough to immerse yourself in the Finger Lakes wine and cider scene, check out Six Mile Creek, a small winery only 10 minutes away from the Commons. With a tasting room and plenty of outdoor seating, the vineyard offers a taste of Ithaca wine, as well as beers and cheeses. Don't worry, if your party includes people under the age of 21, they sell non-alcoholic drinks too!</p>

            <h3>More Local Shopping</h3>

            <p>The Farmers Market is a staple of the Ithaca community. Similar to the Harvest Festival, many local vendors and creators come together to provide their creations to the Ithaca community. Many people come from the surrounding area to visit this market, and you can buy almost anything you want! The best part is they are open almost year round (except for those awfully cold winter months), so you can come back anytime to check it out.</p>

            <h3>Dining</h3>

            <p>Be sure to dine at some of Ithaca's most popular restaurants, like the Ithaca Beer Company, Asia Cuisine, Taste of Thai, Red's Place, Bickering Twins, Hawi, and many many more! Most of these restaurants can be found in the Commons, so they are perfect for dinner after attending the Harvest Festival!</p>

            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

            <h3>How much money should I bring?</h3>

            <p>Entry to the event is completely free! The amount of money you should bring is dependent on what, if anything, you wish to purchase at the festival. If you are driving, there is a $5 charge to park at the parking garage (You can find more parking information here ). If you plan to eat at the festival, you may also wish to bring at least $10. Prices of the various baked goods, produce, and crafts vary by vendor. Many of our vendors and their items can be found here.</p>

            <h3>Can I pay with a credit card?</h3>

            <p>Most of our vendors accept credit cards, however, you should bring some cash in case a shop you are interested in does not accept them.</p>

            <h3>Can I bring my dog?</h3>

            <p>Bringing a dog is strongly discouraged due to pets not being allowed on the Commons. Additionally, the event will be crowded and may be overwhelming for your furry friend, or it may be difficult to move through the crowds. Registered service animals are permitted.</p>

            <h3>What should I wear?</h3>

            <p>If you are not familiar with the Ithaca area, it can get quite cold in the fall! Check the weather and bring layers.</p>

            <h3>When is the best time to attend?</h3>

            <p>If you are looking to avoid the crowds, attending midday Friday is a good idea. However, many attendees find that the crowds on the weekend add to the energy and fun of the festival.</p>

            <h3>Will there be alcohol?</h3>

            <p>Some vendors do sell alcohol (such as hard cider), so be sure to bring your ID if you are over 21. Many of these vendors also offer tastings.</p>
